## Short description
### The Gui of this this project is powerd by PyQt5
### And code logic is coded by Python
* If you want to run this project you have to run `main.py`.
* For playing game you have to login. So you can see the users and their passwords in `users` file in the project.(you can set your own username and password in this file)
* I named the modules meaningful.So I hope you understand each module duty.
* And also I tried to unload Ludo rules in the code.
## How to play
* Its easy. After login in game (at least 2 player) you have to click on  `start game` from game menu above the game window and enjoy playing simple ludo game.
